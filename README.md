# SecurePass-Checker

A command-line tool to assess password strength based on configurable security rules.

Implemented a validation engine to analyze password strength against five security criteria (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character, and minimum length).

Developed a rating system that provides clear, intuitive feedback to the user (e.g., "Weak", "Medium", "Strong") based on the final security score.
